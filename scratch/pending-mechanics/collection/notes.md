collections
===========

is this an abstract core feature?  that works with association and maybe includes wallets for countable assets?

- component systems have slots and objects that can fill those slots
- each object or the collection can provide attributes, stats, tags, descriptions

examples:
- outfits composed of wearables in different slots
- skin decorations composed of tattoos, scars, and distinguishing marks
- vehicles or robots composed of typed parts
- credential packets composed of various id's and permits
