StoryTangl
==========

StoryTangl is an open source interactive fiction game engine.  It is modular and client agnostic, so it can be easily modified and used with a variety of input formats and client interfaces.

The documentation is split into two parts: a user guide for content creators, and a developer guide explaining the backend architecture and apis.
