Worlds
======

A 'World' module is a factory class that generates and manages 'Stories' for players.

The StoryTangl backend can serve many Worlds.  Each World module includes an initialization routine, a resources package for scripts and static media, an optional plug-ins module, and any other code features that the author cares to build into their World.
