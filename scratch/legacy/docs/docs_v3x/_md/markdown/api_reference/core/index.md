# Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental building blocks of the StoryTangl engine.

1. [Entity](entity.md)
   Entities are the basic unit of data in StoryTangl, providing unique identification, labeling, and tagging.
2. [Graph and Node](graph_and_node.md)
   Graphs, Nodes, and Edges extend Entity to support hierarchical and peer relationships, forming the backbone of the story structure.
3. [Mixins and Handlers](mixins_and_handlers.md)
   Reusable components that add specific behaviors and functionality to Entities and Nodes.
4. [SingletonEntity](singletons.md)
   Single-instance objects that can be shared across graphs.

These core concepts work together to create a flexible and powerful system for representing and managing interactive narratives. Each concept builds upon the others, allowing for complex story structures and game mechanics to be implemented efficiently.
