# Petty Calvin Cards

Calvin Card alternative play style.

- Unspoken rules, like cc, mao, etc.
- played like crazy 8s, like mao
- all players decks are shuffled together (there may be more than 2 players)
- final deck is augmented to create equal numbers of each strategy each affiliation plus n rares (i.e., 4 of each strategy in each of 5 affiliations + 5 rares = 25 cards)
- each player picks 5
- a starting card is turned over
- next player may play matching affiliation ('reinforce') _or_ winning strategy ('defeat') to win and shed your card to the top of the pile
- otherwise the player loses, card returns to hand, and they must draw a new card
- first one to zero cards wins
- rares are wild, will always defeat current card.  The next subsequent card will always reinforce them.
- when the draw pile is exhausted, the play pile except the top card is shuffled to create a new draw pile

- takes/losses are described with calvin card descs
- player options for strategies are based on only their cards in hand (or maybe any winning strategies plus a couple of distractors?)

in this case at least, a cc deck can be approximated with a common deck of playing cards, considering each suit as 1 of 4 affiliations, 4x each rps (12 cards), and kings (or 8's) as rares.
