robots:
    # robots are basically vehicles with an abstraction between the chassis and the other four component systems
    components:
    - chassis         # limits power-plant qnd controller quality, provides _durability_

    - power_plant     # provides 'power' (speed, strength)
    - controller      # provides 'control' (range, handling)

    - sensors         # consumes control, provides _range_

    # manipulators
    - fine_motor      # consumes control, provides _handling_
    - coarse_motor    # consumes power, provides _strength_

    # combat
    - ranged          # convert range, handling to damage (if far, penalty for close, req ranged weapon)
