- **Progression**: a tiny-rpg stat progression system and a Block wrapper for stat-challenges

- **Game**: an interactive component and Block wrapper for interactive games, a generic framework for longer stateful interactions
- **Credentials**: an asset-based game framework similar to Pope's "Papers, Please", includes Extras (generic Actors) generation by indication

- **Demographic**: a parametric regional/ethnic name generator
- **Look**: a manager for common references to a character's style and appearance, along with adapters to narrative description and media creation params
- **Wearable**: assets and a state manager for removable clothes
- **Ornaments**: tattoos and other permanent decorations

- **Crafting**: recipes for combining assets to generate other assets
