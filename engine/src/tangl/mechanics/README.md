`tangl.mechanics`
=================

`tangl.mechanics` is a _namespace_ package for story-related concepts that _extend_ or _combine_ concept and episode nodes along with media and discourse controllers. In the current codebase only the **demographics** helpers ship as live modules; the remaining bullet points are legacy planning notes that still need implementation.

- **Demographics**: a parametric regional/ethnic name generator used by `Player` and other concept nodes.
- **Progression** *(in progress)*: a tiny-RPG stat progression system and a Block wrapper for stat challenges.
- **Game** *(in progress)*: an interactive component and Block wrapper for longer-form game loops.

- **Sandbox** *(planned)*: a Scene wrapper for map-based choices and scheduled events, plus an Actor wrapper for peripatetic mobs.
- **Credentials** *(planned)*: a multi-stage asset-based game framework similar to Pope's "Papers, Please", including credential/extras generation.
- **Look** *(planned)*: a manager for character style and appearance with adapters to narrative description and media creation params.
- **Wearable** *(planned)*: assets and a state manager for removable clothes.
- **Ornaments** *(planned)*: tattoos and other permanent decorations.
- **Crafting** *(planned)*: recipes for combining assets to generate other assets.

## Future Thoughts

- Timelines with longer-term cause/effect relationships
- Alternate universe overlays with ability to observe/influence playthroughs already completed
