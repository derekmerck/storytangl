          The Crossroads Inn sits at the junction of three ancient roads.
          Rain patters against the windows as you push open the heavy oak door.
          
          The common room is warm and inviting, lit by a crackling fireplace.
          A few patrons sit scattered at wooden tables.

          You approach the fireplace. The cloaked figure looks up,
          revealing sharp eyes and a weathered face.
          
          "Aria," she introduces herself simply. "Looking for work,
          or just passing through?"

          Aria's expression softens slightly. "The Northern Pass?
          Dangerous this time of year." She pauses. "But I know the way.
          For the right price, I could guide you."

          "Well," the innkeeper leans in conspiratorially, "they say
          the old fortress in the Northern Pass holds treasure beyond
          measure. But the way is treacherous, and strange things
          have been seen in those mountains..."

          You and Aria set out at dawn. The forest path is narrow
          and overgrown, but she navigates it with practiced ease.

          A fork in the path appears ahead. Aria pauses, studying
          both options carefully.
